# Guide for Mentors


## Guideline

	- Make mentoring a priority, only emergencies are more important
		- If they don't feel important, they stop asking questions
		- If they feel like they are taking away from your time to do more important things, they won't ask for your time
	- **Hammer in best practices early on. Take extra time if it's necessary!**
	- Have a roadmap, milestones
		- Technologies
		- Tooling
		- Methods
		- Try setting SMART goals
			- Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-bound
	- Collect information, track their progress, document everything
		- Code reviews
		- Meetings
		- Surveys
		- Day to day operations
	- **Only help them if they want help!**

## Measuring

- Identify trouble spots and opportunities
	- Frequently asking questions about a topic/technology
	- Code reviews shedding light on lack of confident knowledge
	- Inefficient methods/habits
	- **Turn them into opportunities for development**
		- Provide resources (documentation, conference talks, source code)
		- Organise a workshop
- Let them make mistakes
	- Observe their debugging workflow
	- Measure how long it takes them to
		- Solve the problem
		- Give up and ask for help
- Track the health of the mentor-mentee relationship
	- Avoid alienating the mentee
	- Maintain authority
	- Weekly meetings with surveys

## Weekly survey outline

- How are you?
- Do you feel like you've improved this week?
	- Yes? In what area? What helped them improve?
	- No? Reason? No opportunity? Not enough support? Lack of effort?
	- Provide objective feedback from your point of view. (Yes/No, in what way)
- What would you like to improve upon next week?
	- Gather resources
	- Try to delegate tasks that provide opportunities for improvement
- Do you feel like you did your best this week?
	- No? What's holding them back?
- Did you have any problems regarding projects or colleagues this week you couldn't resolve?
	- Yes? What are these? Suggest solutions, inform the Team Lead if necessary
- Tell me about your tasks this week!
	- Likes, dislikes, issues, strengths. Measure!
- How do you feel about the mentor program?
- Is there anything you wish I've done differently?
- Do you want to talk about anything else?

## Things your mentee won't tell you

- I'm confused. What is going to happen now?
	- Help them plan their day
	- Give them a schedule if you deem it necessary
- I don't want to bother you
	- Set time aside explicitly for them
	- Don't make them regret asking
- I'm not sure I'm good enough
	- Seniors are still learning too
	- Provide clear, relevant feedback
	- Positive feedback is important
	- Share your experiences
- I'm bored
	- Menial tasks are good for:
		- Getting to know company practices, coding styles
		- Measuring their knowledge, speed, precision, attitude
	- Seniors are doing boring tasks too
	- They are not being punished, but they're not special either
	- It's a workplace. Do your job :)
