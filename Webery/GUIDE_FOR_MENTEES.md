# Guide for Mentees


## Essentials

- Active listening
	- I respect you by answering, respect me by listening
- Preparing questions
	- Short, to the point, prepared (see ["When and how to ask"](#when-and-how-to-ask))
- Decide when it's enough to just use Slack (out of courtesy). If it's a simple question with a simple answer, we don't break each other's flow. If it's a question that needs a detailed answer, we'll talk.
	- Bonus win: don't disturb others in the room unnecessarily
- Google the exact error message or behaviour you see. (see ["When and how to ask"](#when-and-how-to-ask)) This one thing will answer 50% of your questions. Really.
- Make notes anytime and anywhere if necessary
	- On meetings, **always** make notes
- Use the keyboard more, the trackpad less, learn to be effective with
	- Your OS (most likely macOS)
	- phpStorm (**learn shortcuts**)
	- Terminal (bash)
	- git
- **Know when you have been trying on your own for too long!**

## When and how to ask

- **Before you ask**
	- Google search
		- Exact error message without the system/application specific parts
		- Description of the error/bug
		- Use keywords
	- Read the manual
		- Of the vendor (Concrete5, Symfony, Sonata, Bootstrap etc.)
		- Of the company (package documentation, Confluence)
	- Inspect the source code
	- Try to find an existing package/project that does what you are trying to do
	- Try to reduce your problem to the smallest possible code example
- **How to ask**
	- Start by telling the results of your research to the person you ask
	- Describe what you are trying to accomplish
	- Describe what happens instead
	- Try to anticipate the questions you are going to receive
	- Precision over volume. Make it short, to the point
	- Focus on the symptom, not your guesses, because if you guessed wrong, you might make you both go in the wrong direction
